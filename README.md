# Cyber Issue Scoring for Exploit, Malware, and Vulnerability (EMV)

<!-- Last Updated 11/29/2018 -->


There are a large number of potential exploits, malware, and vulnerabilities (EMV) that can be used to attack control systems on critical infrastructure.  Exploits and malware represent the offense aspects and vulnerabilities represent the maintenance aspects of the challenge. Successfully protecting a control system against these attacks requires a structured process for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and addressing
EMVs. EMV Scoring is needed since other scoring methodologies do not include: Exploits and Malware; applicability to a specific configuration; defense capabilities; consequence; or other adversary factors. A benefit of processing through the EMV Scoring process is the identification of potential threat object characteristics that can be used for automated response.

Idaho National Laboratory (INL) participated as a team member with Southern California Edison on the California Energy Systems for the 21st Century (CES-21) Program and has refined these concepts with the asset owner's point of view to prioritize EMV based on their operational knowledge of the system under protection, sometimes with a limited knowledge of the adversary, but a full understanding of the utilities' ability to defend against potential consequences including the consideration of the asset owner's risk tolerances. This EMV prioritization enables a scored ranking of issues to be addressed. CES-21 uses EMV to determine the creation of indicator and remediation language in automated response technologies, providing for agile response capabilities within substation automation environments.

```

#### Install OrientDB and Configure as a Service


The CIS Application has been tested using OrientDB v3.0.31. New versions may be available, but have not been tested. Download version 3.0.31 by issuing the following command in a terminal window.
```
wget https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/orientdb3/releases/3.0.31/orientdb-3.0.31.tar.gz -O orientdb-community-3.0.31.tar.gz
```

Navigate to the tar file and extract the files. This assumes the downloaded file is in the Downloads folder. In a terminal:

```
cd ~/Downloads
tar -zxvf orientdb-community-3.0.31.tar.gz
```

Move the extracted files to the /opt directory.
`sudo mv ~/orientdb-community-3.2.31 /opt/orientdb`

Start the OrientDB server.
```
cd /opt/orientdb
sudo bin/server.sh
```
You will be prompted to create a password for the root user. Use "OrientPW". If you chose something else previously, then modify line 205 in the following file: src/app.tsx

Configure OrientDB to run as a Service. Open a new terminal window and issue the command:

`sudo useradd -r orientdb -s /sbin/nologin`

Change the ownership of OrientDB

`sudo chown -R orientdb:orientdb /opt/orientdb`

You will need to make a few changes to the orientdb.sh script

`sudo nano /opt/orientdb/bin/orientdb.sh`

Change the directory and user as follows:
```sh
ORIENTDB_DIR="/opt/orientdb"
ORIENTDB_USER="orientdb"
```
Save and close the file (`ctrl-x` then `y`).

Copy the Systemd service
`sudo cp /opt/orientdb/bin/orientdb.service /etc/systemd/system`

You will need to make settings changes as follows:
`sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/orientdb.service`

Modify the User, Group, and ExecStart commands
```sh
[Service]
User=orientdb
Group=orientdb
ExecStart=/opt/orientdb/bin/server.sh
```
Save and close the file (`ctrl-x` then `y`).

Reload the daemon
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

Start the Service

`sudo systemctl start orientdb`

Enable the service to start on boot
`sudo systemctl enable orientdb`

#### Extract EMV Application files

Download EMV from git:
`git clone http://134.20.14.19/ces21/emv.git`


Navigate to the EMV folder, run the following:
```shell
npm install

```
`npm install` is only needed the first time the CIS application is run to install dependencies, or if you update a dependency.

NOTE: Some linux distributions have a problem with `npm install`. In this case, use `yarn install` and `yarn start`.

Login to the EMV Application using the username: `admin` and password: `admin`

NOTE: The OrientDB service needs to be running for the CIS application to connect to the database.

#### (Optional): Build and Executable

Open a terminal and navigate to the EMV directory. Run the following: ==UPDATE==

Create a java profile 'java.sh' in the /etc/profile.d/ directory.
`sudo vim /etc/profile.d/java.sh`

Enter the following to configure java:
```sh
#Setting JAVA_HOME in PATH
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"
export JAVA_HOME
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME
export PATH
```

Make the file executable.
```
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/java.sh

## Advanced Customization

For instructions on editing the criteria set or configurations see Advanced_Customization.md.

## Encrypting Communication

Please follow the instructions provided: https://www.orientdb.com/docs/3.0.x/security/Using-SSL-with-OrientDB.html
You will also have to change any connections to the server from port 2424 to 2434.

NOTE: Some machine's might experience issues with a self signed certificate, to which you can add a line: process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0';.  This fix is fairly unsecure (as it opens up the application to untrusted sources), should be temporary and extended to something more secure.

## Known Issues

- NPM might have outdated packages. This application was built with static versions from npm. If a package is updated, it has the potential to cause issues.
- This application was designed around a single-user system.
- It is assumed that the OrientDB database and EMV application will reside on the same machine. Security concerns exist if the database is moved to another machine as the communication between electron-forge and orientdb is unencrypted.1
